## Game Description & Basic Rules

Our game is a role-playing text-based game, we try to make it similar to Dungeons & Dragons (DND). Players will form an adventure team towards a wild and remote zone. On their adventure, they will beat enemies, collect items, and eventually discover the hidden secret of a mysterious relic.

Players have to beat dangerous monsters along their journey. We introduce a battle system including ATT, DEX, STA, INT (stands for attack, agility, life, intelligence). Besides,Luck involves in our battle, the number of dice a player (or the monster) will have great effect on the fighting, making it unpredictable and more challenging.
